# Research roadmap — Phase 5

## Completed

**R0 — Reference survey:** initial comparison of 28 supplied projects; four initial architectures examined; source/build facts separated from author claims. No reference port built or run.

**R1 — Private intake:** supplied input identified as GOD/SVOD plus three DLC packages and a separate title update. Full base hash-tree verification, safe bounds/path preflight and all package extractions passed. All 38 source game files retain SHA-256/size/mtime. Original XEX hashes, headers, resource inventory and alternate-header/update caveats recorded.

**R2a — Loader and host tooling:** official ReXGlue 0.10.0 runs natively on macOS ARM64; selected main XEX decrypts/decompresses and loads. All 274 imports recognized; all 261 function shims present. A small tool-mode helper inspected sections/imports without running guest code.

**R2b — Deep analysis / minimal generation:** completed with five checked function hints on the unmodified base. GapFill completed, configured Validate passed and private code generation exited 0. Generated output has 48,371 bodies plus 261 imported functions. Two selected partitions compile to Mac objects; no complete link or execution was attempted. The initial run's five branch-target failures and all 109 float16_4 warnings are recorded. The second run exceeded its intended calendar bound because monotonic supervision disagreed with the system timer; no third analyzer run was made. [Commands, coverage and timing caveat](research/rexglue-analysis.md).

**R2c — Isolated VMX tests:** completed with an independent numeric oracle and the actual pinned emitter case. Each O0/O2/sanitized build executed 212,068 synthetic invocations. Finite in-range, distinct-lane and mask 2/3 checks passed. Overflow/infinity differ from IEEE round-toward-zero; same-register conversion corrupts source data. These are characterized gaps, not a hardware-equivalence PASS. No alias appears among the 237 prior game sites. [Methodology/results](research/vmx128-validation.md).

**R2d — Runtime source audit:** all 261 imported functions mapped/classified: 7 IMPLEMENTED, 184 PARTIAL, 61 STUB, 9 UNKNOWN. Exception/STFS behavior, a conservative static early-call closure, reference approaches and license boundaries recorded. No runtime API was implemented or game-specific patch copied. [Complete matrix](research/runtime-audit.md).

**R2e — Runtime component foundation:** original checked bounded memory, host-thread TLS and a diagnostic failure boundary implemented. Six original groups (including 4,000 seeded memory operations) and three SDK leaf groups pass at O0/O2 and with ASan/UBSan. A separate SDK patch fixes source aliasing and TLS bounds/wrap, and returns explicit STFS failure. Patched VMX regressions have zero alias differences; numeric semantics stay unchanged. Installed SDK/game output remain untouched. [Phase 5 contracts/results](research/runtime-foundation.md).

**Independent numeric evidence:** pinned Canary differs from Xenia/ReXGlue in rounding, denormals and upper range; a primary DirectXMath note distinguishes an Xbox variant. No hardware-verified special-value corpus exists here, so no numeric correction is applied.

## Next exact task: R2f — native fault contract and original PPC-context bridge

Investigate the single 45-second native read-only write timeout with a further explicitly bounded, instrumented host-only probe: collect compact stacks/CPU and distinguish enforcement, unclaimed-signal retry, handler failure and diagnostic environment issues. The normal SDK memory allocation/mapping/protection-query lifecycle passed, but actual fault delivery/recovery must not be inferred from that result.

Then connect a tiny original PPC-context fixture to a reviewed subset of actual SDK memory/TLS exports. Keep ownership/bounds, zero/init/cleanup and error outcomes explicit; whitelist supported imports and reject unsupported guest exception behavior. The standalone TLS class is not a PCR/r13 or XThread implementation. Do not silently bypass exception/STFS failures or change RtlCompareMemoryUlong based solely on Windows documentation.

**Acceptance:** deterministic native fail-stop/recovery evidence, an original no-game PPC/export fixture with reproducible sanitizer checks, exact source/binary fingerprints and documented unsupported contracts. Resolve the numeric evidence and required guest exception behavior independently before any separately authorized private early-call trace. Do not boot or compile the full game, add graphics/audio, deploy to Switch or re-run the game analyzer in this work item.

Preserve the exact unpatched XEX, manifest/corrections and prior output. Alternate headers and title updates remain separate future decisions. Fix sleep-inclusive/calendar supervision before any new analyzer budget; Phase 3's two-run allowance remains consumed.

## R3 — independent Horizon probes (not started)

Use original minimal fixtures or appropriately licensed probes: guest address aliases and coherence, required protection/fault semantics, register preservation, threads/waits/APCs, Vulkan presentation/features, audio, pads and SD access. Record exact console/loader/Atmosphère/toolchain configuration. Begin at stock clocks in full application mode. A triangle or successful alias alone does not validate the game runtime.

## R4 — conditional smallest game milestone (not started)

Only after binary/runtime prerequisites are reviewed, choose one private observable milestone based on actual findings, such as entry plus a trace of early platform calls. Boot, rendering, movies/audio, gameplay, saves and sustained performance remain separate milestones. Only two selected generated partitions have been compiled as Mac objects. There is no complete linked game executable or execution result.

## R5 — broader port decision and distribution (not started)

Decide scope from validated shader/runtime behavior and measured physical-memory/stock-clock costs. Select reproducible host/target dependency versions and license closure before release planning. No estimate of FPS, completion date or playable compatibility is justified yet. No GitHub Release or automated binary pipeline is created.
