# Research roadmap — Phase 9

## Completed

**R0 — Reference survey:** initial comparison of 28 supplied projects; four initial architectures examined; source/build facts separated from author claims. No reference port built or run.

**R1 — Private intake:** supplied input identified as GOD/SVOD plus three DLC packages and a separate title update. Full base hash-tree verification, safe bounds/path preflight and all package extractions passed. All 38 source game files retain SHA-256/size/mtime. Original XEX hashes, headers, resource inventory and alternate-header/update caveats recorded.

**R2a — Loader and host tooling:** official ReXGlue 0.10.0 runs natively on macOS ARM64; selected main XEX decrypts/decompresses and loads. All 274 imports recognized; all 261 function shims present. A small tool-mode helper inspected sections/imports without running guest code.

**R2b — Deep analysis / minimal generation:** completed with five checked function hints on the unmodified base. GapFill completed, configured Validate passed and private code generation exited 0. Generated output has 48,371 bodies plus 261 imported functions. Two selected partitions compile to Mac objects; no complete link or execution was attempted. The initial run's five branch-target failures and all 109 float16_4 warnings are recorded. The second run exceeded its intended calendar bound because monotonic supervision disagreed with the system timer; no third analyzer run was made. [Commands, coverage and timing caveat](research/rexglue-analysis.md).

**R2c — Isolated VMX tests:** completed with an independent numeric oracle and the actual pinned emitter case. Each O0/O2/sanitized build executed 212,068 synthetic invocations. Finite in-range, distinct-lane and mask 2/3 checks passed. Overflow/infinity differ from IEEE round-toward-zero; same-register conversion corrupts source data. These are characterized gaps, not a hardware-equivalence PASS. No alias appears among the 237 prior game sites. [Methodology/results](research/vmx128-validation.md).

**R2d — Runtime source audit:** all 261 imported functions mapped/classified: 7 IMPLEMENTED, 184 PARTIAL, 61 STUB, 9 UNKNOWN. Exception/STFS behavior, a conservative static early-call closure, reference approaches and license boundaries recorded. No runtime API was implemented or game-specific patch copied. [Complete matrix](research/runtime-audit.md).

**R2e — Runtime component foundation:** original checked bounded memory, host-thread TLS and a diagnostic failure boundary implemented. Six original groups (including 4,000 seeded memory operations) and three SDK leaf groups pass at O0/O2 and with ASan/UBSan. A separate SDK patch fixes source aliasing and TLS bounds/wrap, and returns explicit STFS failure. Patched VMX regressions have zero alias differences; numeric semantics stay unchanged. Installed SDK/game output remain untouched. [Phase 5 contracts/results](research/runtime-foundation.md).

**Independent numeric evidence:** pinned Canary differs from Xenia/ReXGlue in rounding, denormals and upper range; a primary DirectXMath note distinguishes an Xbox variant. No hardware-verified special-value corpus exists here, so no numeric correction is applied.

**R2f — Native fault diagnostics and original PPC-context execution:** completed within the documented boundary. Two 30-second child/group watchdog reproductions establish SDK unclaimed-signal retry as the Phase 5 hang. Isolated fail-stop/PC-resume fixtures pass. Thirteen real SDK exports, register preservation, memory lifecycle, actual XThread/PCR/r13 and synthetic process TLS pass O0/O2 and limited ASan/UBSan checks. Source patches are tested against real runtime objects; no installed SDK is changed. [Exact contracts, 57 final checks and remaining limits](research/ppc-execution.md).

**R2g — Unified SDK and selected ABI/failure integration:** clean Debug/Release/ASan+UBSan builds of pinned ReXGlue with seven ordered patches completed. All 261 baseline shim symbols are present; one new library supplies Memory/MMIO/dispatcher/thread/export behavior. Original contracts/fault checks plus watchdog regressions total 137 passes. Selected GPR64/stack64/r2/nested callback and TLS-free failures are corrected. Debug private loader-only succeeds; sanitized loader aborts on XDBF alignment. Six additional runtime/vector/pointer blockers are recorded separately. [Exact reproduction and limitations](research/unified-sdk.md).

**R2h — Pre-entry safety:** bounded XDBF byte decoding and synthetic corpus; wide checked allocation arithmetic fixing the saved SIGBUS path; heap-maintained XAM ownership and foreign/stale/double-free rejection; explicit host failure for selected unsupported exception exports; controlled guest reservation/protection checks. Existing eleven-patch SDK sources and all original game/config/generated data are preserved. [Final build/test evidence and limits](research/pre-entry-safety.md).

## R2i / Phase 9 — checked guest accesses and entry-contract gates

Completed the bounded original-fixture implementation and static readiness audit. A real-SDK owner-checked copy layer validates 4-KiB pages and full spans; unsupported fetch and MMIO/host-page padding fail closed. Synthetic import tests expose and correct NtClose accepting closed handles. The literal entry closure has 108 generated functions, 33 imports and 21 unresolved indirect sites. No generated access is mediated and no game code is executed. [Contracts, final regressions and NO-GO justification](research/guest-memory-entry-readiness.md).

## Next exact task: R2j / Phase 10 — original emitted-access mediation and fail-closed dispatch

Route original emitted scalar/stack/vector/atomic/indirect fixtures through a checked backend before proposing proprietary execution. Establish validated executable-section authorization and reject unsupported fetch/dispatch/import signatures. Audit the complete access/lifetime scope and independently test every allowed import contract. Preserve guest unwind, typed-vector, title TLS/TOC and callback limitations until evidence supports a correction.

The following entry-readiness acceptance gate remains open:

**NO-GO for proprietary execution.** Address raw accesses to 4 KiB guest pages sharing 16 KiB host pages, and define a fail-closed entry/import policy. Establish which unsupported vector ABI/exception/error paths are unreachable or refused, title TLS/TOC/dispatch prerequisites, and memory/pointer lifetime boundaries with original fixtures. XamAlloc host exceptions are not an Xbox error-code implementation; complete guest unwinding is not supplied.

**Acceptance before any execution proposal:** explicit checked-access scope, no unresolved critical safety issue on the proposed path, documented failure observability and independently justified required ABI/error contracts. A later readiness review must precede a narrowly bounded private generated-code trace. Full game compilation, game execution/boot, graphics/audio and Switch deployment are separate gates.

Keep the XEX, assets, manifest and prior generated output private and unchanged. Alternate headers and title updates remain separate decisions. Phase 3's analyzer allowance remains consumed; no analyzer is rerun. The saved Phase 8 SIGBUS and exploratory diagnostics remain private evidence rather than being discarded.

## R3 — independent Horizon probes (not started)

Use original minimal fixtures or appropriately licensed probes: guest address aliases and coherence, required protection/fault semantics, register preservation, threads/waits/APCs, Vulkan presentation/features, audio, pads and SD access. Record exact console/loader/Atmosphère/toolchain configuration. Begin at stock clocks in full application mode. A triangle or successful alias alone does not validate the game runtime.

## R4 — conditional smallest game milestone (not started)

Only after binary/runtime prerequisites are reviewed, choose one private observable milestone based on actual findings, such as entry plus a trace of early platform calls. Boot, rendering, movies/audio, gameplay, saves and sustained performance remain separate milestones. Only two selected generated partitions have been compiled as Mac objects. There is no complete linked game executable or execution result.

## R5 — broader port decision and distribution (not started)

Decide scope from validated shader/runtime behavior and measured physical-memory/stock-clock costs. Select reproducible host/target dependency versions and license closure before release planning. No estimate of FPS, completion date or playable compatibility is justified yet. No GitHub Release or automated binary pipeline is created.
